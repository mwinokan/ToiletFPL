12 lucky players competed in the Diamond League this season - or should I say 11 as Kajan Kugananthajothy has been rock bottom since gameweek GW2, and finishes over 200 points below 11th. As Kajan hasn't made a transfer since his GW30 wildcard, he won't be eligible for any end of season awards either. Despite this, his trophy cabinet does contain two üëë King awards, and we do have to commend his valiant effort clawing his way back from 7M in GW17 to 2M in GW26. 

Moving up the league we have Rob Sutton, who in GW6 had reached heights of 250k and 2nd place in the Diamond league, but by the end of the season he has unfortunately fallen short to 11th place. Rob Sutton's reputation has been tarnished forever as this season's üêì Cock and üèö Peasant. Throughout the season he made only 33 non-wildcard transfers, maybe a couple more would have helped him finish higher. Up next is Will Harrington-Clark, who had a stable season hovering around between 500k and 1M rank. He'll be

Most points benched: Edward Capper, 297
Most captain points: Jacob Slater, 321
